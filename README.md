# DaysSinceCaboose
A bot that shows the days since Caboose TV has uploaded.
# Usage
I used cron and my Raspberry Pi 4 to automate this bot to run at 17:00 every day.
Make sure to remove the shebang line if you're running on Windows or OS X.
## Basically it's a python script. Run it.
# Credits
Me, because I made it (obv)<br>
Caboose TV for not having a regular upload schedule: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuxAjoYf0cds_5iQA2yM9Q<br>
And borja (or @borjademian) for the bot idea! Here's their Twitter (not X): twitter.com/borjademian
